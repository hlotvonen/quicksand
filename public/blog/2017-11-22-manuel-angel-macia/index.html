<p><strong>Time:</strong> 19:00–<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> Wednesday 22nd of November<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> Big Auditorium (first floor)<br />
Sandberg Instituut, Overschiestraat 188<br />
<em>The event is open to all.</em></p>

<p>This Quicksand lecture takes the form of a listening session on Latin American popular music. The event explores the pharmacolonial registers of psychotropics and tropical psychedelia. Puerto Rican theorist Julio Ramos coined the term pharmacoloniality to denote an inverse process of ‘colonisation’, whereby Latin American substances—sugar, tobacco, coffee, cocaine, music—are used to ‘wake up’ and stimulate European rationality. While pharmacoloniality defines the conditions of emergence of modern temporality, it also addresses the ambiguous effects and agencies of drugs as technologies of sense. Pharmacoloniality indicates how these ungovernable substances influence contemporary modes of understanding and sense-making. A turn to the aural spectrum offers potential routes towards an intoxicated political economy of sense.</p>

<p>Manuel Á. Macía (PhD, Goldsmiths, University of London) is an interdisciplinary researcher. His practice includes curatorial platforms for knowledge exchange, lecture-performance, video, text-based pieces, and installation. His current research looks at sensory infrastructures and the coloniality of sense. His upcoming research engages with contemporary intersections of Latin American cybernetics and sensory anthropology. He is a member of the Goldsmiths Latin American Hub.</p>
