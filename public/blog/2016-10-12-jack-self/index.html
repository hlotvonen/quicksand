As an editor for Strelka Press (2011-13) he developed the first print-on-demand books on architecture. He also founded Fulcrum, a free weekly “pursuing architecture and the third millennium” based at the Architectural Association in London. He edited Real Estates: Life Without Debt (Bedford Press, 2014) and is a Contributing Editor for the Architectural Review. Recently he spoke about the future of housing at the IABR 2016.</p>

<p>QUICKSAND is a series of student run lectures and dinners. The series is produced by Arthur Röing Baer and Floris van Driel. In the series we ask, as we find ourselves either too centered to influence or too peripheral to care (and vice versa), what are the actual possibilities of politicality within design (&amp; art)?</p>

<p>This evening is funded by the Design department in collaboration with Het Nieuwe Instituut and Critical Studies.</p>

<p>Hope to see all of you there.</p>
