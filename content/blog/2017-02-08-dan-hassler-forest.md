Dan Hassler-Forest is originally from New York, and grew up in the Netherlands. He attained MA degrees in Film Studies and English Literature (cum laude) at the University of Amsterdam. After completing his undergraduate studies, he worked for several years as an editor and film reviewer, culminating in a position as editor-in-chief of the Dutch commercial film magazine Film Scene. Unsatisfied with the superficial nature of mainstream film journalism, he started teaching film and literature courses at the University of Amsterdam in 2005, meanwhile preparing a doctoral research project that combined his interests in popular film, comics cultures, and critical theory. Funded by the Huizinga Institute for Culture and History, he completed his doctoral work in 2010, successfully defending his dissertation on the Bush-era superhero movie genre in March 2011. He now works as an assistant professor of film and literature based in the English Literature department of the University of Amsterdam, and is a frequent public lecturer on contemporary film, adaptation theory, animation and digital cinema, and theoretical approaches to popular culture and cultures of globalization. All of his work is informed by a critical approach to commodity culture and globalized capitalism, with a special focus on the political and ideological implications of fantasy genres.

With ‘critical design’ being either too centred to influence or too peripheral to care (and vice versa), Quicksand explores what contemporary possible strategies for politicality within art & design can be. How can we imagine the unimaginable? This year’s theme concerns itself with imagining and building futures, as we find ourselves overwhelmed by the lack of ideas for possible alternatives.

The event is open to all.

Hope to see you there.
