**Location:** Big Auditorium (first floor)

*The event is open to all.*

This Quicksand lecture takes the form of a listening session on Latin American popular music. The event explores the pharmacolonial registers of psychotropics and tropical psychedelia. Puerto Rican theorist Julio Ramos coined the term pharmacoloniality to denote an inverse process of ‘colonisation’, whereby Latin American substances—sugar, tobacco, coffee, cocaine, music—are used to ‘wake up’ and stimulate European rationality. While pharmacoloniality defines the conditions of emergence of modern temporality, it also addresses the ambiguous effects and agencies of drugs as technologies of sense. Pharmacoloniality indicates how these ungovernable substances influence contemporary modes of understanding and sense-making. A turn to the aural spectrum offers potential routes towards an intoxicated political economy of sense.
