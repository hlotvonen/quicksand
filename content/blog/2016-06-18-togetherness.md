For the graduation show of 2016 Quicksand invites graduating students and external guests fitting the subject matter, to present their agenda followed by an informal conversation on their final project.

Trying to find new horizons beyond existing systems, the works of Juliette Lizotte, Monika Grūzīte & Arthur Röing Baer look for alternative futures – towards new forms of togetherness. After presenting their projects, the three graduating students will discuss their work under the theme of *TOGETHERNESS* with Vinay Gupta (Hexayurt, “Resilliance Guru”), moderated by Niels van Doorn (Assistant Professor New Media Studies and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam).
