Quicksand is a series of student run lectures and dinners. The series was initiated by alumnus *Arthur Röing-Baer* and produced with second year student *Floris van Driel.* For the academic year 2016–2017, a new group of students is joining in the realisation and expansion of the project.

With ‘critical design’ being either too centred to influence or too peripheral to care (and vice versa), Quicksand explores what contemporary possible strategies for politicality within art & design can be. How can we imagine the unimaginable? This year’s theme concerns itself with imagining and building futures, as we find ourselves overwhelmed by the lack of ideas for possible alternatives.

The event is open to all.

Hope to see you there.
